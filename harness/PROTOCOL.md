# Differential harness protocol

The harness proves the Swift implementation matches the TS oracle by running **mixed sessions**:
one simulated document whose clients live in different *peers* (the TS oracle and the Swift
implementation), all consuming one sequenced op log.

```

The driver is the only component that sequences. Peers never talk to each other.

## Scope (phase 0)

Channel level: each client hosts **one DDS channel** behind a mock container runtime, mirroring
`MockContainerRuntime` + `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime` from `@fluidframework/test-runtime-utils`.
Op `contents` are the DDS op exactly as passed to `submitLocalMessage`; there is no datastore
envelope, batching, compression, chunking or ID allocation. Container-level sessions against a real
service come later and extend this protocol.

## Transport

- Peer is launched by the driver; requests on stdin, responses on stdout, **one JSON object per
  line**, UTF-8. Logs go to stderr only.
- JSON-RPC 2.0 shape. One request in flight at a time; the driver waits for each response.
- Every JSON text on the wire is produced by `JSON.stringify` (TS) or `FluidJS.JSONEncoder`
  (Swift), which must be byte-identical for equal values.
- An error is `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":n,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"…"}}`. A peer error
  during a session fails the session (it is a finding, not something to retry).

## Messages

`UnsequencedMessage` — produced by a peer when its client submits:

```json
{ "clientId": "A", "clientSequenceNumber": 1, "referenceSequenceNumber": 0, "contents": { … } }
```

`SequencedMessage` — produced by the driver, delivered to every client in log order:

```json
{ "clientId": "A", "clientSequenceNumber": 1, "referenceSequenceNumber": 0,
  "sequenceNumber": 1, "minimumSequenceNumber": 0, "type": "op", "contents": { … } }
```

`SummaryTree` — the channel summary as returned by the TS `SharedObject` summarize call, in
`ISummaryTree` JSON form. Phase 0 blobs are strings:

```json
{ "type": 1, "tree": { "header": { "type": 2, "content": "{\"value\":5}" } } }
```

## Methods

| Method | Params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `{}` | `{ "implementation": "ts" \| "swift", "ddsTypes": [string] }` |
| `createClient` | `{ clientId, ddsType, channelId, sequenceNumber, summary }` | `{}` |
| `edit` | `{ clientId, edit }` | `{ "outbound": [UnsequencedMessage] }` |
| `process` | `{ clientId, message: SequencedMessage }` | `{ "outbound": [UnsequencedMessage] }` |
| `state` | `{ clientId }` | `{ "state": JSONValue }` |
| `summarize` | `{ clientId }` | `{ "summary": SummaryTree }` |
| `disposeClient` | `{ clientId }` | `{}` |

- `createClient`: `summary: null` creates a new attached channel with empty state at
  `sequenceNumber` 0. A non-null summary loads the channel from it; the client's last processed
  sequence number is `sequenceNumber`.
- `edit`: performs one local edit through the DDS public API and returns every message the client
  submitted as a result (flush mode immediate). `referenceSequenceNumber` is the client's last
  processed sequence number.
- `process`: delivers one sequenced message. The client treats it as local iff
  `message.clientId == clientId`, and then matches it against its oldest pending message by
  `clientSequenceNumber` (as `MockContainerRuntime.processInternal` does).
- `state`: the DDS's observable state in its canonical form (per DDS, below).
- `ddsType` is the DDS factory type string, e.g. `https://graph.microsoft.com/types/counter`.

## Sequencing (driver)

- Unsequenced messages enter a FIFO queue in submission order. A *sequence* step pops the head,
  assigns `sequenceNumber = ++seq`, and appends to the log.
- `minimumSequenceNumber` = min over connected clients of that client's latest
  `referenceSequenceNumber` (initialized to the client's join `sequenceNumber`), matching deli.
- Each client has a **cursor** into the log. A *deliver* step advances one client's cursor by k,
  calling `process` for each message. Clients therefore lag independently, so edits carry varied
  `referenceSequenceNumber`s — the concurrency that conflict resolution must handle.
- *Join*: a new client is created from `summarize` of an existing client with **no pending local
  messages**, starting at that client's cursor. Clients may join on either peer regardless of
  which peer produced the summary.

## Checks

At a *checkpoint*, the driver sequences everything and delivers to every client, then:

1. `state` of every client is deep-equal.
2. `summarize` of every client is identical as JSON text (blob strings byte-exact).

Any mismatch, peer error, or protocol violation (wrong `referenceSequenceNumber`,
`clientSequenceNumber` not strictly increasing per client) fails the seed. A failing seed writes a
trace (`harness/traces/<seed>.jsonl`, every request/response in order) that `replay` re-runs
exactly.

## Per-DDS contracts

### Counter — `https://graph.microsoft.com/types/counter`

- edit: `{ "kind": "increment", "amount": <integer> }` → `SharedCounter.increment(amount)`.
- state: `{ "value": <number> }`.

## Harness generation

Clients are assigned to peer slots round-robin (two `ts` slots are separate processes).
The fixed Mulberry32 generator uses 2–5 initial clients, up to 10 after joins, and 120 random
steps per seed. Integer increments near ±2^53 are isolated between checkpoints, then undone
before random concurrent edits resume: JS addition is not associative outside the safe-integer
range, so concurrent boundary probes can make even two real TS counters disagree legitimately.
Ordinary increments in [-100, 100] retain arbitrary edit/sequence/delivery interleaving.
The sequencer updates the sender's latest reference when sequencing its message, before
computing the minimum over all clients; receiving a message alone does not advance that reference.

## Service mode (M1)

`npm run service -- --seeds 0..9` owns a tinylicious 7.0.1 process on port **7073**
with temporary storage, and launches `.build/debug/FluidServicePeer`. It uses the same
JSON-RPC stdio framing. Requests are serialized; each has `params.client` (a local
client handle). Runtime payloads are recorded, not interpreted in Swift.

| Method | Additional params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | `endpoint`, `document` | view (connection may still be waiting for its own join) |
| `view` | none | view, or error if processing failed |
| `disconnect` | none | null |
| `reconnect` | none | null (retains protocol state and observation log) |
| `signal` | `content` (serialized runtime signal envelope) | null |

A view contains the loaded `snapshotSequenceNumber`, `sequenceNumber`, `minimumSequenceNumber`, quorum `members`,
`proposals`, `values`, raw `audience` entries, `clientId`, `connected`, raw received
`ops`, and raw `signals`. `opSources` is parallel to `ops`, containing `socket` or
`storage`: tinylicious's REST deltas and live broadcasts can carry **different
trace fields for the same sequence number**. No fields are stripped or normalized.
Socket entries compare byte-for-byte with the TS inbound queue before protocol
mutation; storage entries compare with the real TS driver's delta-storage stream.
Quorum and audience compare against the live TS container at equal sequence numbers.

Each seed creates/attaches a TS SharedMap container, opens Swift at creation, edits
from TS, obtains a real acknowledged TS summary, opens another Swift client from
that snapshot, adds a second TS writer, checks a pending quorum proposal while that
writer's outbound queue is paused, resumes it and checks commitment, sends a runtime
signal, disconnects the second TS client, and disconnects/reconnects Swift across a
TS edit. Failures write `traces/service-<seed>.jsonl` with RPC exchanges and checkpoint
views. Service runs clean up their processes and temporary storage on success/failure.

## H1 — container-runtime operation lifecycle

`npm run fuzz:oplifecycle` builds `FluidOpLifecyclePeer` in release mode using
`--scratch-path .build/h1`, then checks seeds 0–999. `--self` runs TS against TS;
`--seeds=10` selects the first ten seeds. No package installation or service is needed.
The peer accepts newline-delimited `{method:"outbound"|"inbound",value:...}` requests,
returns one JSON value per line, and exits nonzero on malformed input. Requests are
serial, with a 30-second response deadline. Failure scenarios (including seed and
configuration) are saved to `harness/traces/oplifecycle/<seed>.json`.

The oracle imports the installed 3.11.0 internal classes directly: Outbox (which
owns the real BatchManagers), OpGroupingManager, OpCompressor, OpSplitter and
RemoteMessageProcessor/OpDecompressor. A real PendingStateManager receives flushes.
The deterministic Mulberry32 generator covers three flushes per seed, grouping
on/off, singleton/multi-message/empty replay batches, explicit replay identities,
ID creation-range envelopes, UTF-16 surrogates, quoting, threshold configurations
(including 614400), and small through multi-chunk payloads. The Swift peer is only
an adapter: batching, transformation and inbound state live in FluidContainerRuntime.

Outbound comparison is exact for serialized uncompressed runtime contents and
metadata. LZ4 compressed bytes intentionally differ between native liblz4 and
lz4js: both payloads are decompressed by the **real TS OpDecompressor** before
comparison. Chunk streams are reassembled only for this payload comparison.
Independently, each Swift compressed payload is passed through the **real TS
OpSplitter** at the configured chunk size; every emitted Swift chunk, envelope,
metadata and serialized chunk-content string must match that oracle output.
Thus differences in codec compression ratio may legitimately change chunk counts,
but cannot hide incorrect chunk sizes, boundaries, framing or final metadata.

Inbound comparison feeds the complete TS wire stream into Swift and compares every
RemoteMessageProcessor result, including null intermediate chunks, batch starts,
key messages, synthetic grouped CSNs and outer batch-start CSNs. The same check is
performed on the Swift wire stream, proving the actual TS decoder accepts it.
Streams are compared with their own sequenced envelopes: differing native compression
ratios legitimately move the final chunk's CSN/sequence number. Missing object
properties are compared as their JSON wire representation, not JS `undefined` keys.

Focused Swift Testing cases port the upstream lifecycle invariants: singleton
bypass, boundary markers, grouped CSNs and identity, UTF-16 splitting/extra empty
chunk, corruption and partial-stream clearing, allocation-before-marking, staged
send suppression, rollback LIFO, marker alternation, exact compression threshold,
empty replay and disconnected pending registration, and synchronous rebase.
Run `swift test --scratch-path .build/h1 --filter FluidContainerRuntimeTests`.

Test-first evidence: the initial TS self-check passed; Swift's API skeleton failed
seed 0 and both initial Swift tests. Native implementation passed 1,000 seeds in
both directions. A planted `chunkId = i + 2` mutation failed seed 7; it was reverted.
Pending-registration and disconnected-empty tests each exposed a separate red case
before their fixes. These are lifecycle tests, not claims of a complete runtime.

Next lanes supply the real pending-state/ack/reconnect policy, ID compressor range
producer, document schema and compatibility configuration, summary persistence of
partial chunks, and datastore dispatch. Outbox exposes synchronous submit, flush,
allocation, resubmit and pending-registration hooks; RemoteMessageProcessor takes
sequenced JSON envelopes and returns the same result shapes as TS. Loader wiring,
legacy loader submission, historical initial-partial-stream recovery, summarizer,
GC and datastores are not implemented by this lane. Live chunk processing is strict.
